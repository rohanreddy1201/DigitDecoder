MNIST Deep Vision

## Description
This project is a multi-file Python implementation of a neural network classifier for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization functionalities. The model is built using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Initialization
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohanreddy1201/MNISTDeepVision
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MNISTDeepVision
    ```
3. Install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas keras matplotlib
    ```

## Run
1. Ensure you have downloaded the MNIST dataset (`mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv`).
2. Modify `main.py` if necessary to provide the correct paths to your dataset files.
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. The script will preprocess the data, train the neural network model, evaluate its performance, and display the visualizations.

## Disclaimers
This project is for educational purposes only. It serves as a demonstration of building a neural network classifier using the MNIST dataset and should not be used for production purposes.
